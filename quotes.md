> Working in a team was also very new to me. In my classes and my job, I enjoy working solo,
but I never grasped how much work you can get done in a team, even when it may be more
frustrating than solo work. I would say that my teamwork has improved greatly, and I would say
that I enjoyed communicating, troubleshooting, and brainstorming in a group.
